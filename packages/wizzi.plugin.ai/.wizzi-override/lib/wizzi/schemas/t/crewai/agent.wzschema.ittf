    e agent : node
        a role
            # Defines the agent’s function within the crew. It determines the kind of tasks the agent is best suited for.
        a goal
            # The individual objective that the agent aims to achieve. It guides the agent’s decision-making process.
        a backstory
            # Provides context to the agent’s role and goal, enriching the interaction and collaboration dynamics.
        a llm
            # optional
            # Represents the language model that will run the agent. 
                \b It dynamically fetches the model name from the OPENAI_MODEL_NAME environment variable, defaulting to “gpt-4” if not specified.
        a function_calling_llm
            # Specifies the language model that will handle the tool calling for this agent, 
                \b overriding the crew function calling LLM if passed. 
            # Default is None.
        a_integer(max_iter, @@null, 25)

        a max_rpm
            # optional	
            # Max RPM is the maximum number of requests per minute the agent can perform to avoid rate limits.

        a_false(verbose)
            # optional	
            # Setting this to True configures the internal logger to provide detailed execution logs,

        a_false(allow_delegation)
            # optional	
            # Agents can delegate tasks or questions to one another, ensuring that each task is handled by the most suitable agent.
            # Default is False.
        a step_callback
            # optional	
            # A function that is called after each step of the agent. 
            # This can be used to log the agent’s actions or to perform other operations. It will overwrite the crew step_callback.
        a_true(cache)
            # optional	
            # Indicates if the agent should use a cache for tool usage. 
        a system_template

            # Default is None.
        a prompt_template

            # Specifies the prompt format for the agent. 
            # Default is None.
        a response_template
            # optional	
            # Specifies the response format for the agent. 
            # Default is None.
        a_false(allow_code_execution)
            # optional	
            # Enable code execution for the agent. 
        a_integer(max_retry_limit, @@null, 2)
            # optional	
            # Maximum number of retries for an agent to execute a task when an error occurs. 
        a_true(use_system_prompt)
            # optional	
            # Adds the ability to not use system prompt (to support o1 models). 
        a_true(respect_context_window)
            # optional	
            # Summary strategy to avoid overflowing the context window. 
        a code_execution_mode
            # optional	
            # Determines the mode for code execution: ‘safe’ (using Docker) or ‘unsafe’ (direct execution on the host machine). 
            default safe
            restrict

        r toolRef/s
            # optional
            # Set of capabilities or functions that the agent can use to perform tasks. 
                \b Expected to be instances of custom classes compatible with the agent’s execution environment. 
                \b Tools are initialized with a default value of an empty list.
