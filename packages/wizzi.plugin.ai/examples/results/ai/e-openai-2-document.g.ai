        title "Identification and Authentication Control"
        description "This requirement focuses on ensuring that all users and devices interacting
            +b with the industrial control system (ICS) are properly identified and
            +b authenticated before being granted access. The goal is to prevent unauthorized
            +b access and ensure that entities accessing the system are verified and trusted."
        { key_aspects
            user_identification "All users must have unique identifiers to ensure accountability and
                +b traceability of actions within the system."
            authentication_mechanisms "Robust authentication mechanisms such as passwords, biometrics, or multi-factor
                +b authentication should be employed to verify the identity of users and devices."
            device_identification "Devices that connect to the network should also be uniquely identified to
                +b prevent unauthorized devices from gaining access."
            "credential management" "There should be processes in place for securely managing user and device
                +b credentials, including creation, distribution, storage, and revocation."
            "access control" "Once identified and authenticated, users and devices should only have access to
                +b resources that are necessary for their role."
            auditability "The system should maintain logs of identification and authentication attempts,
                +b both successful and unsuccessful, to detect potential security breaches."
