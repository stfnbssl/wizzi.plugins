ITTF Format
The ITTF (Indented Text Tree Format) is a text-based format designed to represent complex hierarchical data using indentation to denote parent-child relationships between nodes.
Structure of a Node: Each line of text represents a node and consists of a "name" (the first word, indicating the data's meaning) followed by a single space and a "value" (the subsequent words or characters). For example: address 123 Main Street.

Hierarchy via Indentation: Lines indented beneath a node are its child nodes, forming a hierarchical structure. The level of indentation (e.g., using spaces or tabs) determines the depth of the hierarchy.

Complex Entities: A node representing a complex entity (e.g., an object) has a single parent node with the entity's name and, optionally, an identifier as its value. Its child nodes contain the entity's attributes or nested complex entities.

Node Types: Child nodes can represent either simple attributes (e.g., a string or number) or complex entities with their own child nodes.

Additional Notes:
Nodes at the same indentation level are siblings, sharing the same parent.

Values can be empty (e.g., note ) or consist of multiple words (e.g., description Wireless Mouse).

Multiple instances of the same entity type (e.g., multiple products) are represented by repeating the entity name at the same indentation level.

Example
Below is an example of how an order from a supplier might be represented in the ITTF format:

order
    number 12345
    date 2023-10-05
    supplier
        name ABC S.p.A.
        address Via Roma 10
        city Milan
        postal_code 20100
        country Italy
    product
        code P001
        description Laptop
        quantity 10
        unit_price 1500.00
    product
        code P002
        description Mouse
        quantity 50
        unit_price 4.00
    total 15200.00
